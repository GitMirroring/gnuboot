@chapter Overview

This chapter will explain what is GNU Boot, and how it compares with
somewhat similar projects.

@node What is GNU Boot
@section What is GNU Boot

GNU Boot is a @dfn{boot software} @dfn{distribution}. What this means
will be explained below.

@cindex boot software

If you take a modern laptop computer, and remove the storage devices
(like @acronym{SSD, Solid State Drive}, hard disks, etc) and then
power on the computer, it will typically show something on the screen.

It often looks a bit like that:

What is being displayed on the screen is produced by software which is
often nonfree.

It is often called @acronym{BIOS, Basic Input/Output System} or
@acronym{UEFI, Unified Extensible Firmware Interface} on computers
people are most familiar with. This software is typically stored
inside a memory chip inside the computer mainboard. In some computers,
this software can be replaced by free software.

Depending on how you read the manual, right below you may or may not
see a picture of this memory chip on the mainboard of a ThinkPad X200.

mainboard.}

@sp 2

The goal of this boot software is to initialize the hardware and load
an operating system (like GNU/Linux).

@sp 1

This kind of ``boot software'' exists for a variety of reasons:

@itemize

@item The operating systems require certain hardware components like the
@acronym{RAM, Random Access Memory} to already work when they are
started.

@item The operating system is stored on a storage device(s) (like
@acronym{SSD, Solid State Drive}, hard disks, etc) and part of it needs to be
loaded inside the @acronym{RAM, Random Access Memory} to
work. Something has to do the loading, and this is done in software
for flexibility and/or efficiency reasons.

@item Finally, certain hardware components cannot be auto-detected and
something needs to tell the operating system what drivers to load,
which which settings.

@end itemize

GNU Boot provides such software. It enables to replace nonfree boot
software (typically nonfree @acronym{BIOS, Basic Input/Output System}
or @acronym{UEFI, Unified Extensible Firmware Interface}) on some
computers.

@node distribution
@subsection distribution

GNU Boot is only a distribution because it reuses various software to
produce something that can be installed.

So it is similar to GNU/Linux distributions like Trisquel 11
(aramo) that also reuse various software to produce something that
can be installed.


@node Helping GNU Boot
@chapter Helping GNU Boot

The GNU Boot project needs help with this manual, specifically on
moving information from the GNU Boot website to this manual.

In general there is also a lot of ways to help the GNU Boot project
(from reviewing website pages for very simple mistakes or outdated
information, testing GNU Boot images, etc).

See the
@uref{https://www.gnu.org/software/gnuboot/web/git.html,Helping GNU
Boot} page on the GNU Boot website for the areas where we need help
and on how to help practically speaking (how to contact the project,
where to send bug reports, etc).
