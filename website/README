== Introduction ==
This directory contains both the website in pages/ and build code to
easily build and deploy the GNU Boot website with very few commands.

== Dependencies ==

If you don't want to install Guix just to test the website, you will
need to install the following dependencies:

* autoconf
* automake
* coreutils
* gawk
* git
* graphviz
* grep
* gzip
* lighttpd
* make
* pandoc
* sed
* tar

$ ./autogen.sh
$ ./configure --disable-guix
$ make serve

And if you want to use Guix instead you only need the following
dependencies instead:

* autoconf
* automake
* coreutils
* guix
* make
* tar

And you can use the following commands instead:
$ ./autogen.sh
$ ./configure
$ make serve

== Local deployments ==

Here's how to deploy the website in a local webserver:
$ ./autogen.sh
$ ./configure
$ make serve

If you don't use Guix, remember to do ./configure --disable-guix instead.

Then you can point a browser to http://localhost:8086/software/gnuboot/web/ or
to http://localhost:PORT/software/gnuboot/web/ if you changed the port through
./configure options.


The GNU Boot website build system takes care of some of the
dependencies for you (for instance the static website generator that
is not packaged in any distributions) so you have less work to do to
install or use them on your side.

If you want to test your own modifications to the dependencies of this
build code, you either need to use the configure options to use
external repositories that have your modifications, or you could also
modify the build.sh script to use different git repositories and/or
revisions.

== Deployment on https://gnu.org/software/gnuboot/ ==

The deployment to https://gnu.org/software/gnuboot/ uses rsync. As
gnu.org machine is behind a firewall, so you need to workaround
that.

A way to do that is to get a shell account on fencepost.gnu.org, and
use SSH to forward the connection to gnu.org. This can be done with
something like that in your SSH configuration:

    Host fencepost.gnu.org
       User USERNAME

    Host gnu.org
       User wwwcvs
       ProxyJump fencepost.gnu.org

In the example above you will need to adjust the fencepost USERNAME,
and modify it to suit your SSH setup if needed (for instance if you
use keys in different locations, etc). Of course, you'll have to get
access to gnu.org ssh server too.

See https://www.gnu.org/software/README.accounts.html for more details
about Fencepost accounts, the SSH fingerprints, etc.

For gnu.org, it's easier if you use an ED25519 key for gnu.org as I
have the fingerprints below. See [1] for other options.

To check that everything is setup you can then SSH into gnu.org:
    $ ssh gnu.org
    The authenticity of host '[127.0.0.1]:2224 ([127.0.0.1]:2224)' can't be established.
    ED25519 key fingerprint is SHA256:pmCf0NrBzSSYfg6DdgmlMzPWZzGpXXcPEz6LP1+o5Jc.
    This host key is known by the following other names/addresses:
        ~/.ssh/known_hosts:306: [127.0.0.1]:4444
    Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])?

You can then confirm by pasting the fingerprint like that[2]:
    Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? SHA256:pmCf0NrBzSSYfg6DdgmlMzPWZzGpXXcPEz6LP1+o5Jc
    Warning: Permanently added '[127.0.0.1]:2224' (ED25519) to the list of known hosts.

Note that it is normal for the connection to gnu.org to block at this
point. You can exit it with the Ctrl+D or Ctrl+C key combinations.

At this point everything is setup.

To deploy the website, use the following commands from the website
directory:
    $ ./autogen.sh
    $ ./configure
    $ make publish

Then you can point a browser to https://gnu.org/software/gnuboot/web/

[1]If you want to use RSA the easiest way is probably to contact the
   FSF system administrator that will install your key on #fsfsys and
   also ask that person for the server fingerprint. In that case it
   would be a good idea to also contribute a patch to add the
   fingerprint here.
[2]The 'SHA256:pmCf0NrBzSSYfg6DdgmlMzPWZzGpXXcPEz6LP1+o5Jc'
   fingerprint was confirmed to me the 24 October 2023 on the #fsfsys
   IRC channel on liberachat by Ian Kelling, a system administrator
   that has access to the gnu.org machine: "18:07 < iank> i see that
   SHA256:pmCf0NrBzSSYfg6DdgmlMzPWZzGpXXcPEz6LP1+o5Jc exists on the
   server".
