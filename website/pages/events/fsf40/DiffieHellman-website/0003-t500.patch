-=========

-It is recommended that you update to the latest EC firmware version. The
-[EC firmware](../../faq.md#ec-embedded-controller-firmware) is separate from
-libreboot, so we don't actually provide that, but if you still have
-Lenovo BIOS then you can just run the Lenovo BIOS update utility, which
-will update both the BIOS and EC version. See:

-
-NOTE: this can only be done when you are using Lenovo BIOS. How to
-update the EC firmware while running libreboot is unknown. Libreboot
-only replaces the BIOS firmware, not EC.
-
-Updated EC firmware has several advantages e.g. bettery battery
-handling.
