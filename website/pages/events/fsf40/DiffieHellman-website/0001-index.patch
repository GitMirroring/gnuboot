-==============================================================
-
-It is recommended that you update to the latest EC firmware version. The
-[EC firmware](../../faq.md#ec-embedded-controller-firmware) is separate from
-libreboot, so we don't actually provide that, but if you still have
-Lenovo BIOS then you can just run the Lenovo BIOS update utility, which
-will update both the BIOS and EC version. See:
-
--   [../install/#flashrom](../install/#flashrom)
--   <http://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/BIOS_update_without_optical_disk>
-
-NOTE: this can only be done when you are using Lenovo BIOS. How to
-update the EC firmware while running libreboot is unknown. Libreboot
-only replaces the BIOS firmware, not EC.
-
-Updated EC firmware has several advantages e.g. better battery
-handling.
-
-How to find what EC version you have (i945/GM45)
-------------------------------------------------
-
-In GNU+Linux, you can try this:
-
-    grep 'at EC' /proc/asound/cards
+Most supported ThinkPad laptops contain a H8S Embedded Controller that is pre-loaded
+with proprietary software. It is not recommended that you update such software,
+but on GNU+Linux, on some ThinkPad's (like the X200), you can check the current version with:
+	grep 'at EC' /proc/asound/cards
 
 Sample output:
+	ThinkPad Console Audio Control at EC reg 0x30, fw 7WHT19WW-3.6
 
-    ThinkPad Console Audio Control at EC reg 0x30, fw 7WHT19WW-3.6
-
-7WHT19WW is the version in different notation, use search engine to find
-out regular version - in this case it's a 1.06 for x200 tablet
+'Supported' means that the build scripts know how to build images
+for these systems. Some have been tested and are know to work, some are known to be broken.
