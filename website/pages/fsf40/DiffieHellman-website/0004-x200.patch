 It is believed that all X200 laptops are compatible. X200S and X200

 There are two possible flash chip sizes for the X200: 4MiB (32Mbit) or
 8MiB (64Mbit). This can be identified by the type of flash chip below
 the palmrest: 4MiB is SOIC-8, 8MiB is SOIC-16.

+On 21 April 2015, Lenovo expanded a recall on Lenovo batteries found
+in some ThinkPad models, which includes the X200 and X200S.
 
-It is recommended that you update to the latest EC firmware version. The
-[EC firmware](../../faq.md#ec-embedded-controller-firmware) is separate from
-libreboot, so we don't actually provide that, but if you still have
-Lenovo BIOS then you can just run the Lenovo BIOS update utility, which
-will update both the BIOS and EC version. See:

-NOTE: this can only be done when you are using Lenovo BIOS. How to
-update the EC firmware while running libreboot is unknown. Libreboot
-only replaces the BIOS firmware, not EC.
+Lenovo advised that owners of the recalled models; "should turn off the system, 
+remove the battery, and only power your ThinkPad by plugging in the AC adapter
+and power cord." 
 
-Updated EC firmware has several advantages e.g. better battery
