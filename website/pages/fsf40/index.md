Introduction
============

GNU Boot participates in the [FSF40
hackathon](https://www.fsf.org/events/fsf40-hackathon).

As part of this hackathon GNU Boot has worked on defining some tasks
that you might be interested in contributing to.

If you don't know which tasks to pick, try to maximize the chance of
your work getting into GNU Boot as-is by picking tasks that are easy
for you, and that you have a chance to finish, and to polish for
inclusion into GNU Boot.
