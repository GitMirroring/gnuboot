+@subsubsection GRUB: GNU/Linux RAID
+
+GNU Boot GRUB images support some RAID combinations, but we also lack
+information on which ones do and don't work. Please contact us if you
+have any information on that.
+
+Due to limitations in the grub configuration of the GNU Boot GRUB
+images, we only support 10 RAID volumes (md/0 to md/9), help is
+welcome to fix that.

+@subsubsection GRUB: RAID formats of RAID card vendors
+
+While some GNU/Linux distributions support that, this is completely
+untested in GNU Boot and it is probably not supported. In addition we
+don't support these RAID cards yet ( @xref{Unsupported hardware
+supported by projects reused by GNU Boot}). Help is welcome for
+identifying if we can add support for these.
