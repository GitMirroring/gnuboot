+@subsection Zerocat Chipflasher v2 and its variations
+
+The Chipflasher v2 is shipped with a builtin free firmware that is
+compatible with flashrom and that can be replaced: Zerocat provides
+documentation that explains you how to do that and alternative
+firmwares do exist.
+
+Zerocat also provides documentation that seems sufficient to build a
+Chipflasher yourself and they even sells kits, though we didn't test
+building one ourselves.
+
+The builtin free firmware is capable of controlling various hardware
+components to adapt to a wide variety of electrical / electronic
+conditions typically found when programming laptops boot flash.
+
+Building your own slightly different version the Chipflasher and/or
+installing another firmware that is completely different has real
+impacts on both the compatibility with laptops boot flash and the way
+of using the Chipflasher.
+
+All these differences can be useful, otherwise the Chipflasher v2
+official documentation on the Zerocat website or the chipflasher git
+repository would not document all these in depth.
+
+In order to support well the Zerocat Chipflasher v2 and potentially
+its various variations as well, we chose to take into account these
+differences by considering Zerocat Chipflasher v2 with hardware and
+software variations as flash programmers distinct from the Zerocat
+Chipflasher v2.
+
+So for instance a Zerocat Chipflasher v2 without any builtin firmware,
+with a different firmware than the one that came with the Chipflasher
+v2 (like kick2-connect instead of kick2-flashrom), or a Zerocat
+Chipflasher DevKit (for instance that you built yourself) will be
+considered as distinct flash programmers.
+

+@subsubsection Zerocat Chipflasher v2
+
+The Chipflasher v2 from Zerocat can be used without having to solder
+anything. It is shipped with a Pomona 5252 IC TEST CLIP for SOIC 16,
+an adapter for DIP-8 flash chips and various cables.
+
+Since the Zerocat Chipflasher v2 has a builtin (free) firmware, using
+that makes things much more easy (for instance it is compatible with a
+wide variety of USB serial port adapters), but in some situations that
+can have security implications (as the firmware can for instance be
+modified while shipping the flasher).
+
+For the security implications, @pxref{Security} for more background on
+security first, and then for the security related to using flash chip
+programmers without or with builtin firmwares, @pxref{Installing with
+a 100% hardware flash chip programmer} and @ref{Installing with a
+flash chip programmer that has a firmware}.

+@subsubsection Zerocat Chipflasher v2 without builtin firmware
+
+The Chipflasher v2 without builtin firmware from Zerocat can be used
+without having to solder anything. It is shipped with a Pomona 5252 IC
+TEST CLIP for SOIC 16, an adapter for DIP-8 flash chips and various
+cables.
+
+It is also shipped with a firmware by default. This firmware is
+located in a flash chip that is inside a DIP-8 socket. This means that
+you can remove this flash chip.
+
+If you are not used to do removing chips from DIP-8 sockets, you might
+consider using some specialized tools to help (like a scalpel, some
+tweezers for stamps that you can try to put between the chip and the
+socket to remove the chip without bending its pins, or a chip
+extractor).
+
+While doing that, you might also need to protect the Chipflasher v2
+from static electricity, as this tend reduce the lifespan of
+electronics. You could for instance by using an antistatic wrist
+strap. Alternatives like touching some electrical ground also exist
+but you need to know what you are doing.
+
+Once done you will still need to load a firmware into the Chipflasher,
+but the firmware will come straight from the computer that will
+control the Chipflasher.
+
+While this avoids security issues, since there is no builtin firmware
+anymore, you will need to build and load this firmware yourself. The
+official Chipflasher v2 documentation from Zerocat explains how to do
+that. Ideally you will also need to find a way to verify the
+signatures of the source code of this firmware. And finally loading
+the fimrware may not work with all serial port adapters, though
+compatbility has already been improved over time.
+
+For the security implications, @pxref{Security} for more background on
+security first, and then for the security related to using flash chip
+programmers without or with builtin firmwares, @pxref{Installing with
+a 100% hardware flash chip programmer} and @ref{Installing with a
+flash chip programmer that has a firmware}.
