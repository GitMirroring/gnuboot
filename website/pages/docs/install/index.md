title: Get GNU Boot
...

Buy a computers with GNU Boot
=============================

The FSF maintains a [certification](ttps://ryf.fsf.org) for computers
that mostly work without nonfree software.

Some (not all) of the computers that received the certification are
compatible with GNU Boot. In the case of
[Technoetical](https://ryf.fsf.org/vendors/Technoethical), the
computers that are compatible already come with GNU Boot installed.

As companies listed by the certification are business they are also
supposed to take care of things behind the hood such as testing
against hardware defects to make sure that all the hardware work with
free software (by replacing the WiFi card), make sure the hardware
really work, etc, and it might be the easiest way for non-technical
users to get GNU Boot.

See the [GNU Boot status page](../../status.md) for which RYF
computers are compatible with GNU Boot.

If you are a hardware vendor that is or was listed in
https://ryf.fsf.org/vendors/ and that you sold computers that are
compatible with GNU Boot, please [contact the GNU Boot
project](../../contact.md): we are looking for information on the
product being sold (flash chip size, customization, etc) to best
support them.

Upgrade yourself from an existing installation
==============================================

There is [general purpose documentation](install.md) for technical
users that can help you upgrade to a newer GNU Boot version.
