Manuals
=======

The GNU Boot project started creating a manual
([online](../manual/gnuboot.html), [pdf](../manual/gnuboot.pdf)) to
better organize the documentation about GNU Boot. It also enables to
target a wider diversity of users, contributors and maintainers.

Note that the online manual can also be saved locally. In that case
it's a good idea to use the "Save Page As ..." function of your
browser instead of "Save Link As ..."  to get the picture(s) as well.
