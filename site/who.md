The purpose of this page is to clearly define who works on Libreboot, who runs
the project, how decisions are made, and in general how the project functions.

You can find information about major contributions made to Libreboot, on this
page which lists such people: [List of contributors](contrib.md)

Leah Rowe (founder, lead developer)
===================================

Leah Rowe is the founder of the Libreboot project, and currently the only
full-time developer. Leah oversees all development of Libreboot, reviewing
outside contributions, and has the final say over all decisions. Leah owns and
operates the libreboot.org servers from her lab in the UK. The servers are
running Libreboot of course!

You can learn more about Leah's involvement with Libreboot, by reading her
entry on the [page listing all contributors, past and present](contrib.md)

Developers wanted!
==================

Leah is the only developer right now. This section will be updated when more
developers join the 
project. **Learn how to contribute patches on the [git page](git.md)**

All are welcome to join in on development.
