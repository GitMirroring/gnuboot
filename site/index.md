### What is this? ####

GNU Boot is a free software project aimed at replacing the proprietary
boot firmware that comes with computers with free boot software.

### How this project came to exist ####

We believe computer users deserve to control all the software they
run.  This belief is the key principle of the Free Software Movement,
and was the motive for developing the GNU operating system and
starting the Free Software Foundation.  We believe computer user
freedom is a crucial human rights.

In order to achieve our goal, it is crucial that we call a program
"free" or "libre" only when it is indeed free in its entirety.  When
we talk about specific programs, we must not muddle the facts about
what is free and what is not.  If people start referring to a progran
as "libre," when parts of it are not in fact libre, that tends to lead
the community astray.

Unfortunately, such a muddle happened last year with a boot program
that was free software and is called Libreboot: the development team
added nonfree code to it, but continued to use "Libre" in its name.

Libreboot was first released in 2013. It has been widely recommended
in the free software community for the last nine years. In November
2022, Libreboot began to include non-libre code.  We have made
repeated efforts to continue collaboration with those developers to
help their version of Libreboot remain libre, but that was not
successful.

Now we've stepped forward to stand up for freedom, ours and that of
the wider community, by maintaining our own version -- a genuinely libre
Libreboot, that after some hurdles gave birth to this project: GNU Boot.

### Our short term plans and need for help ###

We are seeking contributors for various jobs, both simple and technical.

The Libreboot name has a long history in the free software community.
Most occurrences of the uses were intended to refer to boot software
that was libre, and there is no way to edit those occurrences to refer
to libre boot software by a different name.  Therefore, we need help
from the wider community to inform people about the inclusion of
nonfree software in the Libreboot releases.

You can also help our project by informing people about this genuinely
free version of Libreboot.

Another way to help this project and take a stand for fully free
software is to change URLs across the web from <libreboot.org> to
<gnu.org/software/gnuboot>, to make sure that the mentioned software
is reliably free software.

While there is some documentation in our git repositories, we also
need help adding explanations on how to contribute, build and test
this website.

Adrien 'neox' Bourmault and Denis 'GNUtoo' Carikli are the interim
maintainers of this GNU Boot project.  They will also review patches
sent to the mailing list. Technoethical (an online shop that sells
hardware compatible with FSF certified distributions) and Libre en
Communs (a French nonprofit that acts and advocates for free software
and the commons) have offered help for testing releases.

Making this project part of GNU is part of our work to ensure that our
genuine Libreboot version remains free and continue to be maintained
over time.
