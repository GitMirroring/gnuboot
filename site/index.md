title: Free your BIOS today!
...

### What is this? ####

Libreboot is a free software project aimed at replacing the proprietary
BIOS firmware with an entirely free version.

### How this project came to exist ####

We believe all computer users deserve to control all the software they
run. This belief is the foundation of a social movement called the
*free software movement*, which consists of a large community of
software users and developers. We believe computer user freedom is a
vitally important goal.

In order to achieve our goal, it is important that when we call a
program free or libre, it is actually free in its entirety. That may
seem like a lot to ask, but it would undermine our goal if we were
flexible on our core belief: freedom.

There are free software programs that are important to the community
and our cause. Sometimes the development team of one of these programs
changes direction and creates the unfortunate situation where a free
program that is used by many begins to include nonfree software. This
is what is currently happening with the formerly free BIOS replacement
Libreboot.

Libreboot was first released in 2009. It has been widely recommended in the
free software community for the last thirteen years. In November 2022,
Libreboot upstream began to include nonfree software. We have made
multiple attempts to work with upstream to keep Libreboot fully free,
but unfortunately our efforts were not successful. As such, we've
taken it upon ourselves to stand up for our principles and the
freedom of the wider community, releasing our own version of a
genuinely libre libreboot.

### Our short term plans and need for help ###

We are seeking contributors for various jobs, both simple and technical.

The Libreboot name has a long history in the free software
community. We will continue to publish the genuinely free boot
software by the name Libreboot. You can help our project by informing
people about this genuinely free version. Another way to help this
project and take a stand for fully free software is to change URLs
across the web from <libreboot.org> to <libreboot.at>, and to let them
know that no other version of Libreboot is reliably free software.

While there is some documentation in our git repositories, we also
need help adding explanations on how to contribute, build and test
this website.

Denis 'GNUtoo' Carikli and Adrien 'neox' Bourmault are the interim
maintainers of this genuine Libreboot. They will also review patches
sent to the mailing list. Technoethical (an online shop that sells
hardware compatible with FSF certified distributions) and Libre en
Communs (a French nonprofit that acts and advocates for free software
and the commons) have offered help for testing releases.

We are taking steps to ensure that our genuine Libreboot will remain
free and continue to be maintained over time.
