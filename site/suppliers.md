These sales fund Libreboot
==========================

For your convenience, Libreboot systems are provided pre-configured. If you
wish, you can also send your system in and have it flashed. The company listed
below is owned and operated by Leah Rowe, founder and lead developer of
Libreboot. Profits from sales are used to fund the Libreboot project, paying
for whatever is needed at any time.

If you don't want to buy one of these machines but still want to contribute
to Libreboot financially, [we have a separate page for that](donate.md)
