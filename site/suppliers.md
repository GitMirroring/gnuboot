title: Buy Libreboot pre-installed
...

For your convenience, Libreboot systems are provided pre-configured. If you
wish, you can also send your system in and have it flashed. The company listed
below is owned and operated by me, Leah Rowe, founder and lead developer of
Libreboot. The Libreboot website and software are provided as a public service,
free for all; I conduct these sales to fund my work. **Shipping worldwide!**
