title: Buy Libreboot pre-installed
...

These sales fund Libreboot development
--------------------------------------

For your convenience, laptops are provided with Libreboot preinstalled.
Trisquel GNU+Linux, endorsed by the Free Software Foundation, is also
preinstalled. They are ready to turn on and use to do all of your computing.

My name is Leah Rowe, and I'm the founder of the Libreboot project. I work
on it every day, provide user support on IRC and generally coordinate
all work on the project. I enjoy doing it, but this is a lot of work.
I'm able to work on Libreboot full-time, because of these sales, which fund
my work.
