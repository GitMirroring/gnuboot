title: Buy Libreboot pre-installed
...

These sales fund Libreboot development
--------------------------------------

For your convenience, laptops are provided with Libreboot preinstalled.
My name is Leah Rowe, and I'm the founder of the Libreboot project. I work
on it every day, provide user support on IRC and generally coordinate
all work on the project. This is a lot of work. I fund my work by selling
systems that come with Libreboot already on them. I ship worldwide.
