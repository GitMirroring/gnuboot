% New Libreboot website

You may have noticed: the site has changed! The old website has been nuked from
orbit. The new site is far improved, especially the Libreboot installation
guides. In general, the new website is much cleaner and easier to navigate.

I'm very close to the new Libreboot release. I spoke of it in a
[previous article](libreboot202104xx.md).

The work on the new Libreboot release has been done in the `libre` branch of
osboot. See:\
<https://notabug.org/osboot/osbmk/commits/libre>

Today, I forked osboot-libre into a new Libreboot repository: `lbmk.git`

You can see the new `lbmk` repository here:
<https://notabug.org/libreboot/lbmk>

The new release is nearly ready. I'm polishing it up, and will be ready soon
with a glorious new release!

PS:

This new Libreboot website is still written in Markdown, but I have *greatly*
improved the static site generator. The static site generator, named *Untitled*
can be seen here in this Git repository:

<https://notabug.org/untitled/untitled>

A website will soon be available for Untitled, hosted here:
<https://untitled.vimuser.org/> (this new site isn't live yet, at the time of
writing this News post for Libreboot).
