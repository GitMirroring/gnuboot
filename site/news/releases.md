% News section for release announcements

The static site generator used on Libreboot's website now supports *unlimited*
news/blog sections, so a dedicated news feed (complete with RSS) has been
created, for release announcements.

Here it is:
[/docs/release/](/docs/release/)

The old `docs/release.html` page is obsolete. The *new* news section above
is where you shall now find change logs. Information from `release.html` has
been transferred to this new section, for older Libreboot releases. The recent
Libreboot 20210522 release announcement has been moved to this new section.

*This* news post is in the main section at [/news/](/news/), which from now on
will not be used for release announcements. Release announcements will now be
done in [/docs/release/](/docs/release/) instead. That section has its *own*
RSS feed, separate from the RSS feed for the main news section, so you should
subscribe to *that* RSS feed if you specifically want to be alerted whenever a
new release of Libreboot is made available.

That is all. To learn more about the static site generator that Libreboot uses
for its website, see:

PS:

I'm the developer of Untitled! The software was officially released on 18 May
2021, and the project website (shown above) was launched on 20 May 2021.
