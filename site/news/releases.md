% News section for release announcements

% 24 May 2021

Previously, [/docs/release.md](/docs/release.md) was used to show change logs
for releases. The static site
generator ([untitled](https://untitled.vimuser.org/)) that libreboot.org uses,
now supports *unlimited* news sections! The older incarnation of that static
site generator had it hardcoded to `news/` and only 1 section was supported.

There is now a new section:
[/docs/release/](/docs/release/)

The old `release.html` page is now obsolete. The *new* news section linked above
is where you shall now find change logs. Information from `release.html` has
been transferred to this new sectio.

*This* news post is in the main section at [/news/](/news/), which from now on
will not be used for release announcements. Release announcements will now be
done in [/docs/release/](/docs/release/) instead. That section has its *own*
RSS feed, separate from the RSS feed for the main news section, so you should
subscribe to *that* RSS feed if you specifically want to be alerted whenever a
new release of Libreboot is made available.

That is all. To learn more about the static site generator that Libreboot uses
for its website, see:

PS:

I'm the developer of Untitled! The project was officially released on 20 May
2021, and the website (shown above) was launched on 22 May 2021.
