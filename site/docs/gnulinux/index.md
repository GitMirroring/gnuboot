This page is useful for those who wish to use the GRUB GRUB payload directly.
If you're using SeaBIOS, the boot process will work similarly to traditional
BIOS systems; refer to the SeaBIOS documentation

GNU+Linux is the operating system of choice, for Libreboot development. It is
highly recommended over any other operating system, precisely because it consists
of [Free Software](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html) (free as in
freedom). There *are* other free operating systems, such as BSD, but most of
the software in a typical GNU+Linux system is also *copylefted*. To learn more
about the importance of copyleft, read this page on the GNU website:
