== Introduction ==
This project enables to easily build and deploy the Libreboot website.

== Local deployments ==
For local deployments you just need to extract the tarball in a
webroot and have a web server serve that content.

== Deployment on Sourcehut ==
Sourcehut has a way to setup a static website by uploading a tarball
of the content. Users that want to deploy a website there are expected
to follow the official documentation[1] to generate a token and add
this token to the id_oauth2_bearer file in the current directory.
