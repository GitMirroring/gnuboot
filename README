== Introduction ==
This project enables to easily build and deploy the Libreboot website.

== Local deployments ==
For local deployments you just need to extract the tarball in a
webroot and have a web server serve that content.

== Deployment on Sourcehut ==
Sourcehut has a way to setup a static website by uploading a tarball
of the content. Users that want to deploy a website there are expected
to follow the official documentation[1] to generate a token and add
this token to the id_oauth2_bearer file in the current directory.

To generate the token, you need to log in and then go on the
https://meta.sr.ht/oauth2/personal-token page. Once there you need to
go in "Limit scope of access grant" and to select at least SITES,
otherwise it won't work (it would fail with the "The specified key
does not exist." message).
